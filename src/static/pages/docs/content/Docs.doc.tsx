      <DocParagraph>
        The Vulcan Gaming Platform is web-based solution for playing Nintendo
        Switch with your friends. The difference between Vulcan and Switch
        Multiplayer is that Vulcan only requires a single player to own a Switch
        and a copy of a game. This user (the "host") connects their console to
        the platform via a hardware device known as a Vulcast.
